College Football Probabilities
===================

This software creates an interactive webpage of college football probabilities using odds and lines from several online betting markets:
* (Bovada)[http://sports.bovada.lv/sports-betting/football-futures.jsp]
* (GT Bets)[http://www.gtbets.eu/betting1.asp?league=CF&specialeventname=2015+BCS+Championship&wagertype=FUTURE&eventtime=]
* (FiveDime)[http://www.oddsshark.com/ncaaf/odds/futures]
* (TopBet)[http://www.oddsshark.com/ncaaf/odds/futures]
* (Sportsbook)[https://www.sportsbook.ag/sbk/sportsbook4/www.sportsbook.ag/getodds5.xgi?categoryId=592]

I also created an (ensemble)[http://www.scholarpedia.org/article/Ensemble_learning].

I use the (KimonoLabs)[https://www.kimonolabs.com/] scraper to collect the data.

## Using R

I wrote the code in [R](http://www.r-project.org/), a free and widely-used statistics-oriented programming language.  There are several excellent references for R beginners:

* [Code School's free, interactive tutorial in R](http://www.codeschool.com/courses/try-r)
* [R in a Nutshell](http://web.udl.es/Biomath/Bioestadistica/R/Manuals/r_in_a_nutshell.pdf)
* A number of freely available "quick reference" sheets such as ones by [Tom Short](http://cran.r-project.org/doc/contrib/Short-refcard.pdf), and staff at the [University of Auckland](https://www.stat.auckland.ac.nz/~stat380/downloads/QuickReference.pdf)

This software relies on R's [shiny](shiny.rstudio.com) package.  For more information on how to install this and other R packages, see [here](http://www.r-bloggers.com/installing-r-packages).
